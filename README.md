This matlab code generates all the figures for the paper 
Pfister, J. P., & Ghosh, A.  A generalized priority-based model for smartphone screen touches

1. In order to generate the figures, it is sufficient to run the following Matlab function GenerateFiguresRevision1.m
This will load the fitted results.

2. To redo the fitting, on line 11 of GenerateFiguresRevision1.m, the regen option should be set to 1, i.e. 
regen = 1. 

3. To display individual figures, the options can be changed accordingly in lines L96-132, e.g. 
Fig1a = 1
will display Fig1a from the paper.
